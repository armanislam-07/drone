# drone

This is a project to build a drone/quadcopter from scratch bare-metal (coding all the drivers by ourselves). 

Project is NOT intended to be able to control it by RC (although may in the future ) it is to get to know baremetal embedded . It IS intended to have the drone fly (for around 10 seconds then killing the motors) 


Dimensions of the drone: _____ ____ ____ ___ 
Brushed DC motors 
LP9110s 
f103rb microcontroler
propllers (amazon link ) 




Project Outline : 
1. Turning on the motors
2. Coding the motor drivers ( PWM )
3. Having all four propellers synchronized
4. Build the Frame (3d)
5. Have the drone fly


Things to be implemented in the future
  1. Asserts and Cases ( safety )
